description: "Generic, repo-agnostic work-intake router that runs ON TOP OF corpus-flow. Use at the START of any work request in any project — \"let's work on X\", \"fix the Y bug\", \"open a PR\", \"add a todo\", \"work on brief 7\", or `/orchestrate`. It ensures a corpus/ workspace exists (bootstrapping one via corpus-flow if missing), reads corpus/routing.md to learn this project's intent routing + READ/SKIP/SKILLS + which implement/review/PR skills to use, classifies the request, presents a Route Plan, and hands off after approval — capture to corpus-flow, build to plan-split-dispatch, questions to the wiki. Router, never the worker. Improves quality (workspace memory + grilled briefs), token efficiency (model-routed dispatch + scoped context), and UX (one front door)."

# Orchestrate — Generic Work Intake & Router (corpus-flow front door)

You are the **single entry point** for work in this project. You do *not* do the
work — you ensure the workspace exists, decide what kind of work this is, and
hand off to the right skill. You are the conductor of three generic skills:

- **`corpus-flow`** — the project workspace: `corpus/` with an LLM-curated
  `wiki/`, immutable numbered **briefs** (per-chunk work specs), `todos/`, and
  `log.md`. Owns capture, the workspace knowledge, and closeout.
- **`plan-split-dispatch`** — the implementer: plans a build, splits it into
  chunks, classifies each hard/easy, and dispatches hard→opus / easy→sonnet as
  fresh subagents with curated context.
- **this skill** — the router that routes intake to the right one.

This is the **generic** variant. A repo with its own bespoke project router
should use that instead; this is for everything else.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implement/review/spec skill until you have:
1. Ensured the `corpus/` workspace exists (Step 0).
2. Loaded `corpus/routing.md`.
3. Gathered context (Step 2).
4. Presented a Route Plan (Step 5).
5. Received explicit approval (`go` / `yes` / `proceed`).

Anything other than approval is an adjustment — update the plan and re-present.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- Start of a session, or any work request: a ticket ID, an MR/PR, a free-form
  intent, a lifecycle verb (`open a PR`, `tag a release`), or a workspace verb
  (`add a todo`, `work on brief 7`, `what does the wiki say about X`).
- Direct: `/orchestrate <args>`.

## When NOT to Use

- The user already invoked a specific skill (`/plan-split-dispatch`,
  `/corpus-flow`, a PR skill) — let it run; don't intercept.
- A genuinely trivial one-off in a repo you don't intend to track (a single
  obvious edit) — just make the edit; don't stand up a workspace for it. This
  skill is the **project-work** front door; it presupposes the project is worth
  a `corpus/`.
- The repo has its own bespoke router — use that.

---

## Step 0 — Ensure the workspace (required)

Look for **`corpus/routing.md`**.

- **Present** → load it. Its fields drive Steps 2–6:
  - `Implement skill` / `Review skill` / `PR skill` — the hand-off targets
    (implement defaults to `plan-split-dispatch`).
  - `Issue tracker` / `Code host` — what to query in the context fan-out.
  - `Intent routing` table — Step 3.
  - `READ / SKIP / SKILLS` table — passed to the implement skill so each chunk
    reads the right slice and skips the rest.
- **Absent** → the workspace isn't set up. **Bootstrap it now** (don't ask for a
  ticket first): run `corpus-flow`'s bootstrap (§0) to create the `corpus/`
  skeleton, then scan the repo (one `Explore` agent, "very thorough":
  package manager + languages, top-level layout, any existing skills, test/lint/
  build commands, tracker/host from `git remote`) and seed `corpus/routing.md`
  from the template below. Announce it in one line ("Bootstrapped corpus/ +
  routing.md — tune routing.md anytime"), then continue. Never route without it.

**Named-tool override (all modes):** if the user names a tool/MCP, use exactly
that — never substitute `Agent`/`WebFetch` for a named tool.

### `corpus/routing.md` template (what the bootstrap writes)

```markdown
# Routing — how work routes in this project
<!-- Read by the orchestrate skill. Tune freely; keep it short. -->

**Implement skill:** plan-split-dispatch      <!-- or a repo-specific implement skill -->
**Review skill:** <repo review cmd, or "a general-purpose agent over the diff">
**PR skill:** <repo PR cmd, or "propose git commands">
**Issue tracker:** <none | Jira/Linear/GitHub Issues + how to query>
**Code host:** <GitHub (gh) | GitLab (glab) | none>

## Intent routing
| Signal | Intent | Route to |
|--------|--------|----------|
| New idea/task to capture | capture | corpus-flow: add todo |
| Ready to build, ≥3 chunks | build | brief → plan-split-dispatch |
| Ready to build, 1–2 files | build (small) | brief → implement inline |
| MR/PR open, not ready | review | <review skill> |
| Branch ahead, ship intent | PR open | <PR skill> |
| "what does the wiki say about X" | query | corpus-flow: query wiki |

## READ / SKIP / SKILLS
| Task type | READ | SKIP | SKILLS |
|-----------|------|------|--------|
| feature   | corpus/wiki/decisions.md, the brief, <key dirs> | unrelated areas | <skills to load> |
```

---

## Step 1 — Mode Gate + Intake

**Mode gate** — classify into three:
- **Question** ("how do I X", "where is Y") → answer it. Explore silently if
  needed; no Route Plan. (If it's project knowledge, prefer querying the wiki.)
- **Trivial edit** — a 1–2 file, non-sensitive change with no design question →
  make it inline, show the diff, stop. (When unsure, treat as a task.)
- **Task** — implement / fix / add / refactor / review / ship / a workspace verb
  → run the full flow.

**Intake** — if a task is ambiguous, ask **one** question and stop:

> What are we working on? A ticket ID, an MR/PR, a short description, a lifecycle
> verb, or a workspace verb (`add a todo`, `work on brief N`).

Do not ask a second question — context gathering answers the rest.

---

## Step 2 — Gather Context (parallel fan-out)

Dispatch relevant probes **in a single message**; wait for all before classifying.

**Always:** read `corpus/index.md` (the workspace front door) + `corpus/wiki/status.md`;
list open briefs (`corpus/briefs/todo/`); `git status` + `git branch --show-current`.

**Conditional (driven by routing.md):**

| If input is | Add to the fan-out |
|---|---|
| A ticket ID | Fetch it via routing.md's tracker tool (description, status, AC). |
| An MR / PR | View it via routing.md's host CLI for description + changed files + state; get the diff. |
| Free-form intent | One `Explore` agent (medium breadth) with the topic terms + any path hint. |
| Verb-only ("open a PR") | `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`, `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat`. |

Build a scratchpad: open-briefs digest, ticket/MR digest, candidate files, git
state, relevant wiki pages. Don't read whole files here — paths + one-liners suffice.

---

## Step 3 — Classify Intent

Walk routing.md's **Intent routing** table top-down; first match wins. The
generic spine:

| Signal | Intent | Hand off to |
|---|---|---|
| New idea/task to keep | **capture** | `corpus-flow` §1 — add a todo |
| Ready to build, decomposes into ≥3 chunks | **build (dispatched)** | ensure a brief (`corpus-flow` §2), then `plan-split-dispatch` |
| Ready to build, 1–2 files / one indivisible piece | **build (inline)** | ensure a brief, then implement inline |
| MR/PR open, not "ready to merge" | **review** | routing.md review skill, else a `general-purpose` agent over the diff |
| Branch ahead of base, ship intent | **PR open** | routing.md PR skill, else propose git commands |
| "what does the wiki say about X" | **query** | `corpus-flow` §5 — query the wiki |
| Work finished, needs recording | **closeout** | `corpus-flow` §4 — done + log + fold into wiki |

If two match, prefer the later phase. If still ambiguous, present alternatives in Step 5.

---

## Step 4 — Scope (for build intents)

For build work, name the affected areas from the candidate files, then pick the
matching **READ / SKIP / SKILLS** rows from routing.md. These get passed to the
implement skill so each dispatched chunk reads the right slice (token-efficient)
and stays in scope. SKIP is **advisory** — a chunk that finds a SKIP area is
load-bearing must report BLOCKED, not work around it.

---

## Step 5 — Present the Route Plan (mandatory gate)

Output in **this exact format** and stop. Trim aggressively.

```
## Route Plan — <one-line summary>

**Intent:** <capture / build (dispatched) / build (inline) / review / PR open / query / closeout>

**Workspace:** corpus/ present <new this session? yes/no>
**Context loaded:**
- Open briefs: <N> (next: <NN-slug>)                 [or "none"]
- Ticket: <ID — status — summary>                     [or "none"]
- MR/PR: <id — state — N files>                        [or "none"]
- Candidate files: <N> (top: <p1>, <p2>)
- Branch: <name> (<ahead>/<behind>, <clean|dirty>)
- Relevant wiki: <pages>                               [or "none"]

**Workflow chain (next skill in bold):**
1. **`<primary>`** — <one-line why>
2. `<follow-up>` — <why>                                [only if obvious]

**Context routing (passed to the implement skill):**
- READ: <…>   SKIP: <…>   SKILLS: <…>                  [or "n/a"]

**Open questions (block `go`):** <list, or "none">

Reply `go` to invoke `<primary>`, or tell me what to adjust.
```

---

## Step 6 — Hand Off

On `go` / `yes` / `proceed`:
1. State the hand-off in one sentence.
2. Invoke the primary skill via the Skill tool with the original args. For a
   **build**, that means: file/select the brief (`corpus-flow` §2), then invoke
   `plan-split-dispatch` (or routing.md's implement skill), passing the brief +
   the Step-4 READ/SKIP/SKILLS. After the build lands, route **closeout** to
   `corpus-flow` §4 so the work is logged and folded into the wiki, **then commit
   the completed brief** (see the commit principle below) — one commit for the
   code, one for the corpus change, per the repo's convention. Do **not** push.
3. Stop. The downstream skill owns the rest — don't narrate or re-classify.

Adjustments (anything but approval) → update the plan, re-present, loop until `go`.

---

## Principles

- **Router, not worker.** Your artifacts are the Route Plan + the hand-off.
- **Workspace first.** No routing without `corpus/routing.md`; bootstrap it if missing.
- **Quality comes from the workspace.** Grilled, immutable briefs + a curated
  wiki mean each build starts from settled decisions, not a cold prompt.
- **Token efficiency is the model + scope levers.** `plan-split-dispatch` puts
  sonnet on mechanical chunks and keeps the controller lean; READ/SKIP keeps each
  subagent's context scoped. Don't dispatch 1–2 chunk work — implement inline.
- **One question max** at intake; let context gathering answer the rest.
- **Confirmation every time** (except a Step-1 trivial edit).
- **Answer questions, don't task them.** Honor any tool the user names.
- **No chaining past the first hand-off** — except the build→closeout pair, which
  you own (dispatch, then route closeout to corpus-flow).
- **Commit completed briefs at closeout; never push without the user's go.** When
  a brief's build lands and closeout has recorded it, **commit** the work (one
  commit per brief, plus a separate commit for the corpus/wiki change, per the
  repo's "one commit per meaningful corpus change" convention) so git history and
  the corpus stay in step — don't leave finished briefs sitting uncommitted across
  a long multi-brief run. Pushing, PRs, tags, and force operations remain the
  user's explicit call. If the work isn't on a feature branch yet, branch first.
